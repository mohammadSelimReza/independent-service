24. Definition:

Authentication verifies the identity of a user or entity, ensuring they are who they claim to be.
Authorization determines what actions or resources a user is allowed to access or perform based on their authenticated identity.

1.Focus:

Authentication focuses on verifying identity, ensuring the user is legitimate and not an imposter.
Authorization focuses on determining the user's privileges or permissions and what they are allowed to do within the system.

3.Purpose:

Authentication establishes trust and confirms the identity of the user to grant access to the system.
Authorization controls access rights and permissions to specific resources or functionalities based on the authenticated identity.

4.Process:

Authentication typically involves the use of credentials (e.g., username/password, biometrics) to validate identity.
Authorization involves evaluating the authenticated identity against predefined rules or policies to determine access privileges.

5.Sequence:

Authentication occurs before authorization. Users need to be authenticated first to establish their identity.
Authorization happens after authentication. Once a user is authenticated, the system determines their access rights based on authorization rules.
